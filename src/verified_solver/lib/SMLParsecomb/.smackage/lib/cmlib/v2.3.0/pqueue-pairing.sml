(* Pairing heap implementation of priority queues.  *)

(* This provides some of the best amortized performance in theory and
   practice among priority queue implementations.  It's implemented
   functionally but heavy persistent branching can cause it to repeat
   expensive operations and fail to meet its amortized bounds.
